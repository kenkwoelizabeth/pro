## Course Project

- This is the final course project for Data Products Course
- The Proect's objective is to create a shiny application
- I have chosen to create a Calories Calculator application.

## Calories Calculator

- Takes in the input as amount of fats, protien and carbs taken (in grams)
- Based on the above information the application calculates the Calories using following formulae:
- Calories = 9 * (gms of fats) + 4 * (gms of protien) + 4 * (gms of carbs)



## R code embedded in the slide

- Input defined are amount of fats, protien and carbs taken (in grams)
- Calculation of Calories

```{r echo=TRUE}
protien_gms <- 10
fat_gms <- 10
carbs_gms <- 10
total_calories <- fat_gms * 9.0 + protien_gms * 4.0 + carbs_gms * 4.0
total_calories
```
